My biggest surprise was the Harmony already had the codes, except Ipod took some sluething and manual button setup.  Being able to use one HDMI cable from the cable box into the VSX-1019ah-k and one cable into the Samsung TV, was great.  One glitch, I did need to run an RCA audio from Directv box into the receiver for some channels, and the receiver at times misses automatically switching from HDMI cable to the tv/sat audio.  My fix is clicking tv/sat for sound, then click the HDMI to get the picture and sound.  Using the microphone to balance and setup the speakers is easy, provided you find the \\\\\"receiver\\\\\" button on remote.  Also having 6 different audio setups on the receiver makes switching from daytime listening, or watching a movie, or listening to Ipod, or even old cd's a breeze, once you have the basic settings you like.  The sound is wonderful.  The receiver has a lot features for audio and video settings, just play with it and browse the manual a couple of times.  I use the volume max on setting, saves me if I turn the unit on after my kids have using it. The Ipod feature is great, the cable is included and connect on the front.  You can use the remote and tv to make your selections.  I am very happy with this unit.    Update on the audio, on March 15, 2010.  My Directv DVR box died and received a replacement from Directv.  Now my audio automatically switches from non HDMI input to the RCA input, hmmm guess it wasn't a receiver problem.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["reviews.shape\n","# sentences.shape\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"OR7f_2LY3Cv3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651463062510,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":204,"user":{"displayName":"Bofan He","userId":"02058615448883407176"}},"outputId":"fd3c3934-3fa4-4f4c-e90c-21f20db8c215"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(10000,)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":177}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Keras\n","from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","tokenizer = Tokenizer()\n","tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)"],"metadata":{"id":"gk75RJs83Csj"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","text_sequences = np.array(tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences))\n","sequence_dict = tokenizer.word_index\n","word_dict = dict((num, val) for (val, num) in sequence_dict.items())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0OhRGnA33CqD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651463138022,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":620,"user":{"displayName":"Bofan He","userId":"02058615448883407176"}},"outputId":"24ffb329-3824-4a91-b2d0-39923877ac6f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:3: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated.
