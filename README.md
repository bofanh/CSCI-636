# CSCI-636
 Big Data Management & Analytics 

## Problem:
 There are millions of production review on Amazon. Manually analyzing Amazon reviews is extremely time-consuming and inefficient. And it would be an impossible task to find trends or patterns over time.

## Goal:
 Doing a Sentiment Analysis on the customer reviews with help of a machine learning model and then using Big Data to process large volumes of reviews.

## Data Source

## procedure

### step 1: load packages
 
 ```
 import pandas as pd
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import sklearn
 from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold

 import nltk
 nltk.download('stopwords')
 ```

### step 2: Preprocess the data

### Step 3: Fitting simple Classfier model to the training set
 Training in different classifier
 to find the best fitting classifier for this dataset

 * Naive Bayes Classifier
 * Support Vector Machine
 * K Neighbors Classifier
 * Gradient Boosting Classifier

### Step 4: Predicting the Result

### Step 5: Visulization
